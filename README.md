# Django-Blog-App
A django base Blog app that also has provision for translation of content into German(for now, will later be extended to more languages),

The Blog App has an admin interface through which blogs are published on the Web App. The front-end is based on Bootstrap. The back-end is based on SQLite3.
Only Admins can post a Blog on the web-app. All blogs are stored in an SQLite3 based database along with the title & publisher of the blog.
